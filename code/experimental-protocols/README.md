# Experimental Protocols for Consciousness Detection

Implementation of consciousness measurement protocols from Part IV of the Helic Axis framework.

## Key Features
- Consciousness Field Interferometer (CFI) implementation
- Consciousness Verification Suite (CVS) protocols
- Quantum coherence measurement tools
- Consciousness authentication systems

## Usage
```python
from consciousness_measurement import ConsciousnessFieldInterferometer

# Initialize measurement system
cfi = ConsciousnessFieldInterferometer()

# Run consciousness detection
signature = cfi.measure_consciousness_field(neural_state)
print(f"Consciousness detected: {signature.field_strength > threshold}")
